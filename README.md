This is one of my moonlight projects.
It's goal is to provide a class library with generic collections that
are not covered by .NETs own collection class libraries.

The one and only currently implemented is BinaryHeap 
(to implement PriorityQueue pattern)

You may access this library in your own projects through my personal NuGet feed. The feed URL
is: https://home.familiepfeifer.de/nuFeed/nuget
You must add that feed in VisualStudio (Tools -> Options -> NuGet Package Manager -> Package Sources)
