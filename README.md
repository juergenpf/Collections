This is one of my moonlight projects.
Its goal is to provide a class library with generic collections that are not covered by .NETs own collection class libraries.

The one and only currently implemented is BinaryHeap  (to implement PriorityQueue pattern).

This library is published [on NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Collections/).
