This is one of my moonlight projects.
It's goal is to provide a class library with generic collections that
are not covered by .NETs own collection class libraries.

The one and only currently implemented is BinaryHeap 
(to implement PriorityQueue pattern)

This library is published through the public NuGet feed.
